# 🗳️ C-Engine-007 — Voter Eligibility Checker 🇮🇳

Part of my **C-Engine Series**, where I develop real-world logic-based mini tools using C programming.

here is the project link :- https://github.com/OmkarRele09/C-Engine-007/blob/main/votereligibilitychecker.c

## 🔥 About
This program checks if a person is eligible to vote based on age.  
A simple but meaningful real-life project representing conditional decision-making.

## 📐 Logic Used
- If age >= 18 → Eligible  
- Else → Not eligible  

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- User input using `scanf()`
- `int` variable type
- Basic `if–else` conditional statements

## 🧩 Example
**Input:**  
Age: `20`

**Output:**  
`You are eligible to vote`
